    <h3>Breed History</h3>
    <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for
        centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as
        sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense
        of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of
        extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering.
        Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
